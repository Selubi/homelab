# homelab
My { random.choice([overengineered, janky]) } homelab setup. But hey, that's the point!

Mainly uses Ubuntu Jammy as OS.

Uses [1Password Secrets Automation](https://developer.1password.com/docs/secrets-automation) for secret handling.

TODO:
- GitHub actions to do ssh tasks
- Move to ansible maybe
